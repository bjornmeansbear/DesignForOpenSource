# DesignForOpenSource
Course idea for a class related to Open Source software and tools — how does a Graphic Designer use these tools and fit into this ecosystem?

Current estimated cost/materials for student:
- Raspberry Pi B model3 ≈ $45
- Power supply ≈ $10
- Memory card w/ Raspbian already installed ≈ $20
≈ $70–100 for physical stuff (use beyond the end of this course...)
