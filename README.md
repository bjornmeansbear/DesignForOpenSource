# DesignForOpenSource
Course idea for a class related to Open Source software and tools — how does a Graphic Designer use these tools and fit into this ecosystem?

Current estimated cost/materials for student:
- Raspberry Pi B model3 ≈ $45
- Power supply ≈ $10
- Memory card w/ Raspbian already installed ≈ $20

≈ $70–100 for physical stuff (use beyond the end of this course...)

## Synopsis
So, the plan would be that we all use an open source computer. We then fill it with open source design and publishing software — Scribues, Inkscape, GIMP, etc. We maybe explore server-y webby things too. We document issues we run into, find problems that we think we can design solutions too, or invent new features for. Figure out how to integrate with the community to start making these things a reality. How can designers that aren't really capable of writing computer code (like C++, etc. that the actual software uses to run) able to participate in the Open source process? Can we design better interfaces? Can we help make things more usable? Is there a different sort of aesthetic, and usability interest for these tools than for say, and Adobe or Apple tool? Are we just replicating what existing "for profit/mainstream" tools are doing? Or are we trying to find a way that we integrate the principles of "Open Source" into aesthetic and functional/usability choices as well? What even does Open Source mean? Is there "Open Source Graphic Design?"

whew.
